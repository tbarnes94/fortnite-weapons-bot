# fortnite-weapons-bot
A bot that returns fortnite weapon statistics based on input from Discord users.  Written in TypeScript.

* bot.ts is the bot itself.  taken some code from https://github.com/MyMICDS/MyMICDS-Discord-Bot.

* ignore ./src/commands/* --> this was left in as a reference in case I should need to make any more commands.

* ./src/web-crawlers/all/web-crawler-all.ts creates the json in ./database/weapons/all/*, this is a json representation of the information
* at https://db.fortnitetracker.com/weapons (Table View)

* ./src/web-crawlers/all/web-crawler-one.ts creates the json in ./database/weapons/one/*, this is a json representation of the information
* at https://db.fortnitetracker.com/weapons/<weapon name>.  There is some information injected from the **all** json

Bugs:
- some jsons generated by web-crawler-one.js are offset for some reason (they are the stats for other weapons)
- not all incorrect command syntax are covered by try-catch blocks, need this to prevent crashes
- help message can be formatted better (also triggers incorrect syntax message)
- !weapon <weapon> <rarity> lootProbability needs some work, as there are nested json in the values for these
